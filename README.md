```

## üéØ Project Context

This project originated from **Task 3** of the Elevvo Pathways internship program, which required building a landing page for a fictional task management app. However, I decided to challenge myself by implementing a complete solution with a functional backend - using technologies I had never worked with before.

## üí° The Learning Challenge

**The Goal**: Learn and implement ASP.NET Core, C#, and PostgreSQL from scratch while delivering the required frontend.

**The Timeline**: Completed in just a few days, proving that solid programming fundamentals enable rapid adaptation to new technologies.

**The Result**: A fully functional task management application demonstrating both the required frontend skills and newly acquired backend capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend (`/client`)
- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn-ui** - Modern UI component library
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and transitions

### Backend (`/server`)
- **ASP.NET Core** - Web API framework (newly learned)
- **C#** - Backend programming language (newly learned)
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database (newly learned)
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM for database operations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- PostgreSQL

### Frontend Setup (`/client`)

1. Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Backend Setup (`/server`)

1. Navigate to the server directory:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Restore .NET dependencies:
```bash
dotnet restore
```

3. Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=taskflow;Username=your_username;Password=your_password"
  }
}
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

5. Start the API server:
```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## üìã Features

### Required Deliverable (Internship Task)
- ‚úÖ **Landing Page**: Professional design with hero section, features, testimonials, and pricing
- ‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all device sizes
- ‚úÖ **Modern UI**: Clean, professional appearance
- ‚úÖ **Interactive Elements**: Smooth animations and hover effects

### Additional Implementation
- **Task Management Interface**: Full CRUD operations for tasks
- **RESTful API**: Complete backend with proper HTTP methods
- **Database Integration**: Persistent data storage with PostgreSQL
- **API Documentation**: Clear endpoint structure and responses

## üéì Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates several key learning principles:

### Technology Adaptation Speed
- **C# Language**: Learned syntax, object-oriented principles, and .NET ecosystem
- **ASP.NET Core**: Mastered Web API development, dependency injection, and middleware
- **PostgreSQL**: Implemented database design, queries, and Entity Framework integration
- **Full Integration**: Connected frontend and backend with proper CORS configuration

### Transferable Skills
The rapid learning was possible because of existing knowledge in:
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Variables, functions, loops, conditionals
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Database Concepts**: Tables, relationships, queries (adapted from other SQL databases)
- **API Design**: REST principles, HTTP methods, JSON data exchange
- **Development Workflow**: Version control, debugging, testing

### Key Insights
1. **Foundation Matters**: Strong programming fundamentals enable quick technology transitions
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Similar concepts exist across different tech stacks
3. **Documentation Skills**: Ability to quickly parse and apply technical documentation
4. **Problem-Solving**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable learning chunks

## üîß API Endpoints

### Tasks
- `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /api/tasks/{id}` - Get task by ID
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` - Update existing task
- `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` - Delete task

### Example Task Model
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Complete project documentation",
  "description": "Write comprehensive README and API documentation",
  "isCompleted": false,
  "createdAt": "2024-08-23T10:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2024-08-23T10:00:00Z"
}
```

## üìä Development Timeline

- **Day 1**: Research ASP.NET Core architecture and setup development environment
- **Day 2**: Implement basic CRUD API with Entity Framework
- **Day 3**: Set up PostgreSQL integration and database migrations
- **Day 4**: Configure CORS and connect frontend to backend
- **Day 5**: Testing, debugging, and documentation

## üîç Technical Highlights

### Backend Architecture
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class TasksController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ITaskService _taskService;
    
    public TasksController(ITaskService taskService)
    {
        _taskService = taskService;
    }
    
    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<ActionResult<IEnumerable<TaskDto>>> GetTasks()
    {
        var tasks = await _taskService.GetAllTasksAsync();
        return Ok(tasks);
    }
}
```

### Database Configuration
```csharp
public class TaskFlowContext : DbContext
{
    public TaskFlowContext(DbContextOptions<TaskFlowContext> options) : base(options) { }
    
    public DbSet<TaskEntity> Tasks { get; set; }
    
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<TaskEntity>()
            .HasKey(t => t.Id);
    }
}
```
